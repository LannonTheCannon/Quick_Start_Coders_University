    **Understanding the Skill Progression:**
    - **Python**: Rapid initial growth, with steady progression throughout the program as more advanced concepts are introduced.
    - **Web Development**: Begins after initial Python fundamentals, showing quick acceleration once the basics are established.
    - **Data Analysis**: Introduced mid-program, building on Python skills and showing significant growth in later stages.
    - **AI Integration**: Introduced in the latter half of the program, demonstrating rapid growth as students apply previously learned skills.

    This chart illustrates how different skills are introduced and developed over the 36-week program, showcasing the comprehensive and well-structured nature of the curriculum.
